## Type Test Project
### Creator OMID FARHANGNIA ###
- This is a project for using the javascript skills and working with Events , Timers , Functions and ...
- I Used Bootstrap for removing repeated css styles for my element.
- This is not a responsive design
### discription ###
- At the first you should choose the time of your test you have some choice(1 , 2 , 3 , 5) Min.
- Then you can see an animation before starting test that this is a counting down element (you have 3 second for making yourself ready for starting the test).
- Now you should do your best try to type so fast because you should increase your score.
- Ok Times up wait for calculating the score.
- Then you can see your score and your skill (weak to pro).
- Dont worry you have the other choice as much as you want you can click on the Restart btn for restarting your test.
- But before starting you should verify the time do you want to change your time?
- If you dont need any change you can skip.
- If you need to change the time you can change it so easy just click Change Time btn.
- Ok change your time and start again dont forget that you always have a new chance for having better score.
### i Didnt work on the responsive shape of this project for some reasons : ###
- First : more the users when they want to giving a test for their type speed they use laptops and PCs.
- Second : i prefer to adding more feature of the site instead of making this website responsive.
- Third : this project was going to be a traning for working with javascript in real project.
